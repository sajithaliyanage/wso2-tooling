            WSO2 Integration Studio Kernel provides a set of core plugins which can be used to develop Eclipse plugins for
            the WSO2 products which are based on award wining WSO2 carbon platform. After a major architecture revamping
            with version 4.0.0, WSO2 Developer Studio is moved in to a kernel based model. All the product specific
            plugins will use the Developer Studio Kernel as the base for their implementation.
